Hardware Guide
***********************************

You can follow the :ref:`quickstartguide` to learn how to start collecting data right away.
However, we recommend reading this section carefully if you're going to use our hardware.
It goes into detail about how each of the components that make up the acquisition system functions and how to use them.

We're going to assume a basic understanding of electronic circuits. If you don't have any hands-on experience working with electronics, check out our `course materials on extracellular electrophysiology acquisition <https://open-ephys.github.io/ephys-course/>`_, which covers basic electronics necessary for electrophysiologists.

It would also be helpful to read through the documentation available on the `Intan website <https://intantech.com/products_RHD2000.html>`_ to learn more about the RHD2000 amplifier chips.
